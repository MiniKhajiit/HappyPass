# HappyPass
Simple password generator script via .txt files

The Alphabetizer only for readability - it's not essential

The .txt files are scrubbed from different lists and personal additions, the Main script will take any .txt file so feel free to replace. 
Since the .txt files are non-essential, they can be replaced with whatever you want.

Also, the dictionary for character replacement is a first pass - It could use some help.

But otherwise, here's a prototype for a happier password that meets modern security standards :P
